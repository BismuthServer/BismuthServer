# BismuthServerðŸ’–
Custom Bismuth server jar built with Mixins! Built based on [VanillaMixins](https://github.com/Nessiesson/VanillaMixins) by [@Nessiesson](https://github.com/Nessiesson), using the Forge Team ForgeGradle server tweaker source code. Credits to all of the Forge(Gradle) Team for providing this amazing platform and Mumfrey for providing the Mixin library.

Further credits go to the the Carpetmod team (such as Xcom6000, gnembonMC, 2No2Name, et.,al.) who have provided some of the code used in this mod.
